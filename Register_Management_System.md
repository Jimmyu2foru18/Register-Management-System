# Register Management System Roadmap

## **Project Scope**

### **System Objectives**
Develop a **robust, scalable, and secure Register and Inventory Management System** with:

1. **Employee-level access**:
   - Perform sales transactions efficiently.
   - View inventory levels in real-time.
   - Print receipts for customers.
2. **Supervisor-level access**:
   - Manage inventory (add, update, remove products).
   - Generate low-stock alerts and approve reorder suggestions.
   - Monitor sales and inventory reports.
3. **Admin-level access**:
   - Oversee all user activity and permissions.
   - Manage stores, branches, vendors, and system configurations.
   - Generate comprehensive reports for transactions and system audits.

### **System Features**

1. **Inventory Management**:
   - Track inventory in real time with low-stock alerts.
   - Automated reorder suggestions based on sales trends and thresholds.
   - Batch product updates using CSV uploads.
2. **Order Management**:
   - Generate and manage order forms.
   - Integrate with vendor APIs for automated order submission.
3. **Transaction Management**:
   - Barcode-based product entry for rapid transactions.
   - POS-style interface with receipt generation.
4. **Hierarchical Access and Security**:
   - Role-based permissions: Employee, Supervisor, Admin.
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for admins and supervisors.
   - Activity logging for auditing purposes.
5. **Scalability**:
   - Support for multi-store deployments with centralized administration.
6. **Offline Functionality**:
   - Cache essential data to allow offline transactions and inventory updates.
   - Synchronize with the central database once online.
7. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Visual dashboards for sales, inventory, and performance metrics.
   - Forecasting sales trends using historical data.

## **Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Planning and Requirements Analysis**

#### **1. Stakeholder Engagement**
- Meet with store owners and staff to:
  - Understand operational workflows.
  - Identify pain points with current systems.
  - Define customization needs for the specific store environment.

#### **2. Requirement Prioritization**
- Mandatory:
  - Transaction processing.
  - Real-time inventory updates.
  - Low-stock alerts and reorder management.
- Optional:
  - Mobile app for supervisors.
  - Integration with loyalty programs.

#### **3. Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React.js (UI), Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend**: PHP (Laravel Framework for rapid development).
- **Database**: MySQL with AWS RDS for high availability.
- **Hosting**: AWS (EC2 for backend, S3 for static assets).
- **Additional Tools**:
  - **Barcode Scanning**: Integrate with hardware-compatible libraries.
  - **Email/SMS Alerts**: AWS SNS or Twilio.

### **Phase 2: System Design**

#### **1. Database Design**
**Schema optimized for performance and store-specific use cases**:
- **Users**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`, `branch_id`, `2FA_status`.
- **Products**: `id`, `name`, `category`, `price`, `stock_quantity`, `min_stock_level`, `reorder_quantity`, `barcode`.
- **Transactions**: `id`, `user_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `total_price`, `payment_method`, `transaction_date`.
- **Orders**: `id`, `supervisor_id`, `admin_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `status`, `order_date`.
- **Branches**: `id`, `location`, `manager_id`.
- **Logs**: `id`, `user_id`, `action`, `timestamp`.

#### **2. Role-based Permissions Architecture**
- Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with middleware to enforce:
  - **Employee**: CRUD transactions, view inventory.
  - **Supervisor**: CRUD inventory, approve/reject orders, view reports.
  - **Admin**: Full system access.

#### **3. UX/UI Design**
- **POS Interface**:
  - Minimalist, intuitive design.
  - Quick access to common actions (scan barcode, process payment).
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Multi-store view with drill-down capabilities.
  - Configurable alerts for critical actions.
- **Mobile-first**:
  - Responsive design for all roles.

#### **4. Scalability and Reliability**
- **High Availability**:
  - Use AWS RDS Multi-AZ deployment for MySQL.
  - Set up load balancers for backend EC2 instances.
- **Data Backup**:
  - Automated daily backups using AWS Backup.
- **Offline Sync**:
  - Use IndexedDB or localStorage for caching transactions locally.

### **Phase 3: Development**

#### **1. Frontend Development (React.js)**
- **Components**:
  - POS interface for employees.
  - Inventory management and order approval modules for supervisors.
  - Comprehensive admin panel.
- **State Management**:
  - Use Redux or Context API to manage app-wide state.
- **Barcode Scanning**:
  - Integrate hardware support using browser-compatible libraries.

#### **2. Backend Development (Laravel + PHP)**
- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - **Employee**:
    - `POST /transactions`: Log sales.
    - `GET /products`: Fetch product details by barcode.
  - **Supervisor**:
    - `POST /inventory`: Add/update product inventory.
    - `GET /inventory/alerts`: Fetch low-stock products.
    - `POST /orders`: Create reorder requests.
  - **Admin**:
    - `GET /reports/sales`: View sales trends.
    - `POST /users`: Add/edit user roles.
    - `GET /logs`: Access system audit logs.

#### **3. AWS Integration**
- **EC2**:
  - Host backend APIs.
  - Serve React frontend using Nginx.
- **RDS**:
  - Optimize MySQL performance for concurrent transactions.
- **SNS**:
  - Send SMS alerts for low-stock notifications or critical issues.

#### **4. Offline Mode Development**
- Use Service Workers for caching:
  - Cache transactions locally.
  - Sync data with the server when online.

#### **2. Hardware Compatibility Testing**
- Test with barcode scanners and receipt printers.

#### **3. Load and Stress Testing**
- Use JMeter to simulate high transaction loads.

#### **4. Security Testing**
